# react-navigation-guard

## Why react need navigation guard?  
React is pretty cool. I like to make something with React, but i need more. Vue have 'navigation guard' basically, it is kinda function that activated when url changed. React also can use 'history' for navigation checking and it makes developer control component in the react-router. But, 'history' options needed to set in the each of every component and i don't wanna do that. Nevertheless, React is nice, there's no doubt. But i'm greedy. I want more.  

## So?  
I want to make React's navigation guard. It can be simple and not powerful, but i want it. I already have some plan, but i don't think i can do this fast. I have to finish company's project first. Maybe it will take couple of months.
